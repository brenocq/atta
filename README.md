Atta is a robot simulator for 2D and 3D applications. For now, the core is still under development.

This project is not yet well documented, I am creating a website in parallel to document the source code and project examples, but it is not yet available.

**Now I am refactoring the entire atta software architecture to be able to perform high-performance simulations and be easier to add new features (decoupling components). Please check the 0.0.1.0 branch if you want to test the previous version**
